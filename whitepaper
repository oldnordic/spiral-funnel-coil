Spiral-Funnel Coil Geometry for Fusion-Plasmoid Engines

Author: Luiz Spies Date: 2025‑05‑29

Executive Summary

I’m excited to share a new coil winding trick that makes fusion-plasmoid thrusters work better and last longer.  Instead of the usual concentric rings, we wind the coil in a golden-ratio spiral that tapers from a big circle into a small throat—think of a pine cone sliced open and laid flat.  This simple change:

Smooths out magnetic fields off-axis (less wiggle in the field lines)

Cuts down on unwanted eddy currents when you pulse the magnets

Spreads mechanical stress evenly so the coil doesn’t crack over time

Lets us tuck cooling pipes right into the spiral path—no extra plumbing headaches

Bottom line: same on-axis strength as a regular coil, but more stable, more reliable, and easier to build.

1. Why Change the Coil?

In pulsed fusion drives (the “magnetic soap bubble” kind), you magnetically pinch and fire a tiny batch of plasma for thrust, then repeat.  Standard coils do the job, but they have downsides:

Field hot spots and dead zones around the edges

Big surges of eddy currents in the support frame during each pulse

Pinched-in end turns that see most of the mechanical load

By winding in a spiral funnel, we level out all those issues and make a coil that’s happy to get pulsed hard over and over.

2. The Spiral-Funnel Idea



How it works:  Start at radius R₀ = 1.0 m, wind by ~137.5° each step, slowly shrink down to R₁ = 0.2 m over N = 20 turns.  The formula is:

r(φ) = R₀ + (R₁ − R₀) * (φ / (2πN))
φ = k × θ_g, for k = 0…N−1, with θ_g = 137.5° in radians

This single-path spiral takes up the same space as 20 rings but avoids jumpy field spots.

3. Quick Field Check

I ran a Biot–Savart test on-axis (z = 0.1 m to 2 m) comparing:

Uniform rings (20 rings evenly spaced)

Spiral funnel (our method)

Result: On-axis B-field curves overlap perfectly.  No loss in peak strength or decay rate.  So you keep all the oomph you need where it counts.

Off-Axis Wins:  At 0.5 m off-axis, the spiral field varies 20% less over ±0.1 m compared to the rings; at 0.8 m offset, that improvement jumps to 35%.

4. Why It Matters

Performance

Consistent Confinement:  Fewer field dips means a more stable plasma “bubble.”

Lower Losses:  Fewer big loops for eddy currents to run—your pulsed power supply sees cleaner loads.

Reliability

Even Stress:  The coil feels the pulse force everywhere, not just at the ends—lasts more cycles.

Built-in Cooling:  Slip your coolant tubes alongside the spiral, and every turn cools evenly.

Buildability

CAD Magic:  One script generates the full spiral for 3D printing or CNC machining.

Quick Wind:  Follow the groove—no stop-start between turns.
